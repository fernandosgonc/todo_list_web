# TAS.K.IT :ballot_box_with_check:
## A simple project I created in order to practice, as I'm currently studying Java and Java Web Applications, where the user can organize tasks in a to-do list. Each task is inside one notebook, or Agenda as it is called, so the app can be used to separate different types of tasks, like Personal and Work tasks. Each task may have a name, a category, a deadline and a status.

### Status
Under construction... :hammer:

### Features
- [x] User register
- [x] Sign in
- [x] Create new agendas
- [x] Edit existing agendas
- [x] Create new tasks 
- [x] Edit existing tasks
- [ ] Filter showing taks within specific time period (i.e within the next 7 days)
- [ ] Alterations in users' personal information

### Used Technologies
#### -> Back-end
- MySQL - Server 8.0
- Java 8
- Servlets 3.1
- JBcrypt (a class that provides an algorithm to hash passwords)
- Apache Tomcat 7
- Junit 4

#### -> Front-end
- JSP
- Expression Language â†’ JSTL
- CSS
- Little scripts in JavaScript

### WHAT I LEARNED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT

- Relational tables, foreign keys and select inner join
- User authentication and session management
- The concept of hashing passwords before storing in database
- Data transference through requests
- Differences between redirect, dispatch, forward, include
- A little more about MVC pattern

### DIFFICULTIES

- Deal with relational tables in database
- Deal with select inner join
- Deal with expression language to render data
- Communication between servlets and jsp using EL 
- URL handling with servlets/jsp pages
- Design the controller to be a single servlet

#### P.S.: I intend to implement this webapp using the Spring Framework in near future
